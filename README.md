This is an information app i have created for my project on app design. 
My app has 6 different buttons on the home page that when anyone of the users choosing navigates them to that section
The categories i have are Top 5 Players, Rugby Teams, Tournaments, Top 5 Rugby Derbies, Top 5 Rugby Moments and Rugby Union Vs League
I created the buttons on the main page using a grid and setting up the rows and columns settings then
Also in each page i have created a tabbed page in the classes for the user to swipe through each page with ease
I hope to keep updating settings and other parts of it as i had a great interest in designing it and learning more about this course.
