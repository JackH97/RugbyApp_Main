                    <Label Text="The Irish overturned a 6-0 interval deficit with early second-half tries from Brian O'Driscoll and Tommy Bowe. Stephen Jones kicked his third and fourth penalties and appeared to have won the Triple Crown for Wales with a drop-goal with five minutes remaining. But Ronan O'Gara's drop-goal regained the lead with two minutes left, and Jones's last-gasp penalty fell short. Wales, from being within two minutes of denying Ireland a Grand Slam, but not their first-ever Six Nations title, suddenly had to come to terms with finishing fourth in the championship."
