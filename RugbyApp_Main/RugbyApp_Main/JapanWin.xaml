                    <Label Text="A big Day for Japanese Rugby this was as a victory over probably one of the best international sides of all time, Japan put on a masterclass to beat the springboks 34-32 in the 2015 Rugby World Cup Group Stages. Japan had not won a World Cup game since 1991, while South Africa were world champions in both 1995 and 2007. The Springboks had named their most experienced Test side in history, with 851 caps in the starting XV, but they were below par in a number of areas."

We thought we could compete but to beat South Africa is a fantastic achievement for the team and it's a great day for Japanese rugby. Japan can only play one way, we've got a little team, so we have to move the ball around and cause problems. If you are a child in Japan you will watch this and you will want to play rugby for Japan [who are hosting the tournament in 2019] in the next World Cup."

It was unacceptable and I take full responsibility. Every game is going to be tough but there are no excuses. We scored four tries but our discipline was not good enough and we can't give so many penalties away."
